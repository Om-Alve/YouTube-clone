# YouTube Clone

This is a simple clone of YouTube built using only HTML and CSS. It is not intended to be a fully functional clone, but rather a basic example of how a website like YouTube could be constructed using these technologies.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the command line or by downloading a ZIP file from the GitHub page.

> git clone <repository_url>

Once you have the repository on your machine, simply open the index.html file in your web browser to view the YouTube clone.
